\section{\underline{Introduction}\ Desires, Not Necessities}

My idea of a Dream Computer is a bit like my idea for living a financially independent life: have enough in the bank so that you won't have to worry about anything. What I mean to say is, I'd like to have strong enough components so that I shouldn't have to worry about my system being outdated for a long time. This is not a cost-effective approach, but neither is buying a Lamborghini Aventador to enjoy some road time. I do love an indulgent tech purchase, and nothing beats playing with a machine that is way out of my league. My main concern for a Dream Computer is its ability to play any game I throw its way, and to smoothly run any program within average consumer reach.
\subsection{Experience}

\epigraph{\textit{Hey, I can dream can't I?}}{Mr. Potato Head \ Toy Story}
I would like to disclose the fact that I have never never built a PC from scratch, taken one apart to study the guts, nor learned the introductory facts necessary to broach the shoreline of this vast ocean of a topic. The closest I can say to having any experience is shopping for a gaming laptop, traversing the lists of components, selecting the beefiest items, and burning fistfulls of cash. All this means is I have a vague idea of manufacturers, and some of their more famous components. Thankfully, this is the Dream Computer, and I will be doing more or less the same thing, and hey, I can dream, can't I?

\section{MY DREAM COMPUTER}

You should list the specification of the computer here. If
you want make a table here, please label the table. See Table
\ref{tbl:example} for an example of a table.

\subsection{Case}
What is life without a little bit of hilarity? Although I want my high performing components to be housed by something that isn't merely a futuristic light show beneath my desk. The LIAN LI PC-CK101L Black Aluminum Mini-ITX Tower is a beast in its own right, and would be perfect for sprucing up the shiny intensity of the components, with a nod to old school coolness.

\end{figure} 


\subsection{GPU}

This graphics card will need no introduction, because even an unitiated  member of the NMT CSE Discord server, like myself, will have been rocked by the wake of new NVIDIA-card discussions among the tech-savvy PC builders. I have been a happy owner of a RTX 2080 in my current PC, so I can only lick my lips  thinking about what is possible with NVIDIA's new RTX 3080. I will safely assume all of my gaming needs will be met with this card.
\subsection{CPU}

My CPU was chosen almost exclusively for its age. My current Intel 8th gen Core i9 is doing a fine job, and still isn't required by the modern games I've come across, so I can't the 10th generation will be made obsolete any time soon.
\subsection{Memory}
Although I didn't go as ballistic as possible with the RAM choice, I did choose a sufficiently large enough memory to allow for any of my personal tasks to be accomplished while even running a high end video game. Overclocking with modern RAM will be more than enough to give just enough oomph for anything this humble gamer can muster.
\subsection{Monitor}
When it comes to monitors or TV screens, I really do find myself having an annoying eye to detail. Until my eyeballs melt from the exposure of what our glowing rectangles mete out, I will be pursuing the absolute best quality images that I can buy. The Acer Predator X27 screen is a top class monitor, and looks beautiful. I love HD playback with movies and streaming, and I am in love with what new generations of video games are able to bring to modern 4k screens. This is an indulgence I couldn't possibly regret.

\subsection{HDD}
In this component, size is my only consideration. I do not have enough understanding of alternatives to HDD components, other than their storage space. Here, above all else, is where I know I am exposed as a simple man. As referenced in my introduction, I really just want to know that I'll never have to worry about running out of a particular item's ability. 5TB sounds too much? Yes, yes it does.
\subsection{Total Cost}
With no regard for the cost, I can safely crunch the numbers of my Dream Computer without risk of heart attack:\$399.95 + $699.99 + $439.99 + $126.99+ $1999.99 + $115.33 = \underline{\textbf{$3,782.24}}
\\\footnotesize{I am embarrassed to say that this price is nearly identical to what I have paid for my current Alienware m17 gaming laptop...}

\section{PROBLEMS WITH BUILDING THIS COMPUTER}
Technical know-how is my greatest obstacle for creating this Dream. I realize that I must have skipped out on so many smaller detail parts in this process as well. This is a HUGE problem. A realistic scenario would involve hiring a very trustworthy expert to assemble the pieces I bring them, which would in turn create a labor cost. I would also have to completely rebudget my current living expenses as I pursue my CS degree at NMT, which is the most serious logistic problem, assuming I could reliably build this Dream PC.

\section{CONCLUSION}

Without having the technical expertise necessary to undertake such a large project, I do believe that the components of my Dream Computer are beyond sufficient for my usually ordinary PC gaming routines. I have yet to push the boundaries of my current computer, and I doubt I'd be able to punish a system that is much stronger. Although my budget, parts, and philosophy are not humble in this project, my gaming needs are. The Dream Computer would do just fine for me.
